# README.md
First, thank you for coming to this page and reading about me. That means a lot, and I want you to know that.

My name is Ryan Reeves, and I've been teaching myself computer science using the ample resources available online. My goal is to become a professional software developer not only as a means to financial ends, but also to bring personal satisfaction in creating wonderful and useful software that I can call my own.


My learning plan is based on [Open Source Society University on Github](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). In addition to these courses, I'll be building my own projects and contributing to others' open-source projects. Below is a list of courses completed, in-progress, and those that next on my roster, ordered chronologically.
