# README.md
I began pursuing a career in computer science almost two years ago, before that I studied education, having received a Bachelor's of Science from MTSU. I've been teaching myself computer science for over a year using the ample resources available online. I have a good understanding of basic computer science concepts, and I'm very trainable. Mastery will follow with experience. 


My learning plan has so far been heavily supplemented by [OSSU on github](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). Below is a list of courses completed, in progress, and those that I plan to take and complete, ordered chronologically.
