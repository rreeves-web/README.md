# README.md
Hello,

I've been a heavy computer user for most of my life, starting when I played Runescape all day as a 10-year old, chatting with peers on IRC and posting on forums.
Now, I'm taking a dive into the technical aspects of computers.
I'm learning about software, hardware, and networking.
I look forward to not only contributing to software projects, but developing some of my own.
