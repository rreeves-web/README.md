# README.md
Hello Dear Reader,

My name is Ryan Reeves. I'm from Lexington, Tennessee, a small town around two-hundred yeras old with population less than 10,000 since its appearance. I performed very well during primary and secondary schools, then left high school for TTU in Cookeville, Tennessee to pursue Mechanical Engineering. That was going great, but I had to withdraw from courses for personal reasons; my GPA was 3.9, so it wouldn't be right to say that I flunked out. After some time for life to resolve, I returned to academia for the start of a new career, and after one turn or another, I ended up with a diploma in my hand for a career I couldn't stand. The search for better days began!

I only found (and fell in love with) computer science recently, before that I was pursuing a career in education having received a Bachelor's of Science from MTSU in Murfreesboro, TN. However, for many reasons whose homes are not here, I chose to begin entering the world of CS. I've been teaching myself computer science for over a year using the ample resources available online. The bulk of my beginning progress has been with Harvard's CS50x course, where I learned foundational details of algorithms, memory, and data-structures using the C langauge. The last third of the course introduces Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as the idea of frameworks with Flask as the course's example.

As they say, the more you know, the more you know you don't know. I now feel that I have a good base of understanding across many fundamental computer science concepts, for example I'm confident that I could learn and become proficient in any language. The elusive 'mastery' of a language feels far off, but programming is a process of building large things out of smaller ones. Mastery will follow with experience, I truly believe. My learning plan is extensive and follows much of the ideology and layout of the OSSU repository on github: https://github.com/ossu/computer-science. I'm moving through MIT's 6.0001 course even though it's another introductory course because I believe the algorithmic practice and focus on OOP will be a great boon.

I'm beginning my job-search now, and will be updating this README as time progresses.

Thank you for reading, and may God bless you.
