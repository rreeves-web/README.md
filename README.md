# README.md
To whom it may concern,

I began pursuing a career in computer science almost two years ago, before that I studied education, having received a Bachelor's of Science from MTSU. I've been teaching myself computer science for over a year using the ample resources available online. I have a good understanding of basic computer science concepts, and I'm very trainable. Mastery will follow with experience. My learning plan has so far been heavily supplemented by *[OSSU on github*](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).

Progress:
~~Harvard's CS50x~~
MIT's 6.0001
